## Quick Reference

| ID | Pattern | Freq | Tier | Handle | Enforcement |
|----|---------|------|------|--------|-------------|
| P1 | Missing Infrastructure | 11% | 1 | "Built the house, forgot the plumbing" | `pre-write-guard.py` |
| P2 | Wrong Ordering | 4% | 2 | "Poured concrete before the rebar" | step-08 verdict + step-09 tag |
| P3 | Enforcement Gap | 6% | 3 | "Guard dog that sleeps through break-ins" | Design principle only |
| P4 | Self-Inconsistency | 5% | 2 | "Left hand contradicts right hand" | step-04 gate (framework files only) |
| P5 | No Scaling Strategy | 7% | 2 | "Planted the tree, forgot the pot has a bottom" | step-05 gate + step-03 epic |
| P6 | Orphaned References | 7% | 1 | "Road signs pointing to demolished buildings" | `post-session-refs.py` |
| P7 | No Validation Before Action | 5% | 2 | "Prescribed medicine without checking the patient" | step-08 checklist |
| P8 | Missing Lifecycle | 5% | 2 | "Birth certificate but no death certificate" | step-05 gate |
| P9 | Incomplete Specification | 7% | 2 | "Blueprint says 'door here' but not what size" | step-05 gate |
| P10 | Domain Mismatch | 5% | 3 | "Hired a plumber to fix the wiring" | Design principle only |
| P11 | Invisible Cost | 6% | 3 | "Free samples that cost $50 in shipping" | Already covered: `session-budget.py` |

## Enforcement Tiers

- **Tier 1 — Hook-enforceable (99% catch rate):** Deterministic, file-level signals. Runs automatically.
- **Tier 2 — Workflow-step-enforceable (60-80%):** LLM reasoning at story/design gates. Fires within workflow steps.
- **Tier 3 — Design principle only (30-50%):** Cannot be reliably automated. Awareness is the only defense.

**Core rule:** "If it's not a hook, it's a suggestion. Suggestions get ignored."
Tier 3 patterns are honestly labeled as such. They require human vigilance or periodic adversarial review.

## Tier 1 Patterns (Hooked)

### P1 — Missing Infrastructure (11%)
**What:** New directories or features created without required companion files (barrel exports, bookend steps, trajectory files).
**Detection:** `pre-write-guard.py` checks against `infrastructure-manifest.md` on every new file creation.
**Evidence:** FSD features without `index.ts`, workflow dirs without `step-00`, behaviors without `evolution/`.

### P6 — Orphaned References (7%)
**What:** Path references in markdown/yaml/json that point to files that no longer exist (moved, renamed, deleted).
**Detection:** `post-session-refs.py` scans `git diff` for path references, verifies targets exist on disk.
**Evidence:** Protocol paths pointing to `docs/research/` after move to `_kdbp/core/`, broken skill references.

## Tier 2 Patterns (Workflow Gates)

### P9 — Incomplete Specification (7%)
**What:** Entity formats declared but not fully specified (e.g., "stores user data" without field definitions).
**Gate:** `create-story/step-05` Design Quality Gate. Rating: COMPLETE | HAS_GAPS.

### P5 — No Scaling Strategy (7%)
**What:** Persistent entities created without declared growth bounds (max items, TTL, archival strategy).
**Gate:** `create-story/step-05` + `create-epics/step-03`. Rating: BOUNDED | UNBOUNDED.

### P8 — Missing Lifecycle (5%)
**What:** Entities with creation mechanism but no retirement/cleanup/archival mechanism.
**Gate:** `create-story/step-05` Design Quality Gate. Rating: HAS_LIFECYCLE | MISSING.

### P4 — Self-Inconsistency (5%)
**What:** Changes to framework files (CLAUDE.md, hooks, workflows) that contradict existing rules.
**Gate:** `dev-story/step-04` — fires ONLY when implementation plan touches `_kdbp/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `_ecc/`.
**Scope:** Compares planned changes against current rules. Not a general consistency checker.

### P2 — Wrong Ordering (4%)
**What:** Operations performed out of sequence (e.g., writing before confirming, mutating before validating).
**Gate:** `dev-story/step-08` code-reviewer emits P2 verdict. `step-09` copies as audit tag.
**Harvestable:** `grep -r "ORDERING:" docs/sprint-artifacts/`

### P7 — No Validation Before Action (5%)
**What:** Assumptions acted on without verification (e.g., file exists? user has permission? value is non-null?).
**Gate:** `dev-story/step-08` code-reviewer checklist item.

## Tier 3 Patterns (Design Principles Only)

> These CANNOT be reliably hooked or automated. They require human judgment,
> periodic adversarial review (via `/kdbp-evolve-behavior`), or external testing.

### P3 — Enforcement Gap (6%)
**What:** Rules that exist in documentation but have no enforcement mechanism (hook, CI, or gate).
**Why unhookable:** Meta-pattern — "are the hooks working?" leads to infinite regress. The detection mechanism for P3 IS the periodic adversarial review process itself.
**Mitigation:** Every rule in CLAUDE.md states its enforcement mechanism. Rules without hooks are labeled as such.

### P10 — Domain Mismatch (5%)
**What:** Using the wrong tool/pattern/abstraction for the problem domain (e.g., relational thinking for graph data).
**Why unhookable:** Pure judgment call. The LLM making the mismatch cannot reliably detect it — that's WHY it's a mismatch.
**Mitigation:** Architecture review by a different agent (or human) than the one who designed it.

### P12 — Survival/Portability (5%)
**What:** Solutions that work in the current environment but break when moved (path assumptions, env-specific deps).
**Why unhookable:** Requires testing in the TARGET environment, not analysis in the source. `.gitkeep` checks (P1) cover the deterministic portion.
**Mitigation:** Template deployment testing across multiple projects. P1 infrastructure manifest catches the file-level subset.

### P11 — Invisible Cost (6%)
**What:** Operations that appear cheap but accumulate significant hidden cost (token waste, redundant CI, process overhead).
**Status:** Already covered by `session-budget.py` (compaction tracking) and `session-stop.sh` (cost logging). No additional mechanism needed.

## Usage

**For code reviewers:** Scan the quick-reference table. Tag findings with pattern IDs: `[P6] broken ref to...`
**For architects:** Check P9/P5/P8 at design time. Don't wait for code review to catch specification gaps.
**For evolve-behavior:** During The Roast (step-05), check each finding against this table — is it a known pattern?
**For retrospectives:** `grep -r "\[P[0-9]\+\]" docs/` to see which patterns recur most.
